[Under Construction]

- Topic: Openning ELF binaries.
   + Openning an ELF binary of any type for reading or writing is carried out with:
      
     ++ bool elf_open_object(const char *path, elfobj_t *obj, uint64_t load_flags, elf_error_t *error)
        ++ Arguments           
           +++ path: File path of the candidate ELF binary.
           +++ obj: A pointer of type 'elfobj_t' which will be passed into other libelfmaster functions for further analysis.
                    This object is an opaque type whose fields should only be accessed by the libelfmaster API. To avoid memory leaks, when
              	    you are done using the 'obj', call elf_close_object(elfobj_t *obj) to free/unmap the underlying memory references associated with
                    the object. 

           +++ load_flags: A set (bitwise OR'ed) or single constant used to define how the ELF binary should be loaded/processed by libelfmaster.
               
               +++ ELF_LOAD_F_STRICT : Only load the binary if ALL headers have structural and logical integrity.
               +++ ELF_LOAD_F_SMART : Load any binary that the kernel can load.
	       +++ ELF_LOAD_F_FORENSICS : Perform section header and symbol table reconstruction if they are either missing or corrupt.
               +++ ELF_LOAD_F_MODIFY : Enables binary modification.
               +++ ELF_LOAD_F_ULEXEC : Used for userland execution debugging API.
               +++ ELF_LOAD_F_MAP_WRITE : Undocumented.
               +++ ELF_LOAD_F_LXC_MODE :  Used when scanning binaries within an LXC container.

           +++ error : An error object to be written to by libelfmaster API should an error occur in a function that recieves it as a parameter.

        ++ Return
           +++ A boolean value of 'true' is returned when the binary was successfully loaded and 'false' when it is not.

- Topic: Error handling.
  + Where `elf_error_t *error` parameter is available for a given function, error handling can be performed by checking if the return value is of type
    boolean 'false' and retrieving the error message via `elf_error_msg(&error)`, where `error` is of type `elf_error_t` and was previously passed to the       function presently being error handled.
	
	elf_path = argv[1];
	if(!elf_open_object(elf_path, &elfbin, ELF_LOAD_F_FORENSICS, &error)) {
		fprintf(stderr, "%s\n", elf_error_msg(&error));
		return FAIL;
	}


- Topic: Closing ELF binaries.

  + Closing resources associate with type `elfobj_t` is achieved by calling `elf_close_object(elfobj_t *obj)`. Resources include
    memory allocations for holding the underlying ELF file (achieved by mmap() syscall) and the associated file descriptor.

    ++ void elf_close_object(elfobj_t *obj)
       +++ Arguments
           ++++ obj: A pointer of type elfobj_t that was initiated with `elf_open_object()`.
       +++ Return
           Nothing is returned.

- Topic: Retrieving ELF attributes

  + ELF attributes such as those found in the `e_ident` (see ELF manpages) can be retrieved with "getter" functions that access 'elfobj_t' type objects.
    
    ++ Retrieving ELF architecture.
       +++ libelfmaster utilizes enum type 'elf_arch_t' (defined in `libelfmaster.h`) which currently has three 
	   integral constants: 'i386', 'x64', and 'unsupported'. Constant `i386` corresponds to 32-bit architecture, 
           second 64-bit architecture and finally unsupported, for architectures libelfmaster does not recognize.

           ++++ elf_arch_t elf_arch(elfobj_t *obt)
                +++++ Arguments:
		      ++++++ obj: A pointer of type elfobj_t that was initiated with `elf_open_object()`.
                +++++ Return:
                      Returns on of the enum type elf_arch_t constants (discussed above) to signify the architecture identified with the binary.
